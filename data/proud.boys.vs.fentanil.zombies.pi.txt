IV. The Clash
A. The two groups inevitably come into conflict
1. A planned protest against the local government's decision to ban body hair ignites the confrontation. The Proud Boys see it as an affront to their rugged manliness, while the Fentanyl Zombies view it as an oppressive attack on self-expression.
2. Chaos ensues as the sleep-deprived Fentanyl Zombies show up hours late, still high from an all-night rave/poetry slam. The Proud Boys, having practiced military formations all week, are outraged at the lack of punctuality.

B. Satirical depictions of the absurd and extreme behavior of both groups
1. The Proud Boys' militaristic tactics and over-the-top patriotism
- They march in perfect goose-step, chugging protein shakes and shouting patriotic slogans like "No shave, no mercy!"
- Their leader, a man calling himself "Sgt. Hairyback," rallies them with a bullhorn, bellowing: "Today, we make a hirsute stand against this vile attempt to defoliate our freedom!"

  2. The Fentanyl Zombies' incoherent chants and drug-fueled antics  
     - Garbling woke rhetoric through the haze, they chant: "Arms hairy, legs hyper-smooth! Existence is resistance, let your pits be your truth!"
     - In a feeble attempt at art/protest, they begin furiously scribbling haikus about shaver-privilege on each other's bodies with permanent markers.

  3. The two groups begin hurling insults and eventually devolve into a massive brawl
     - Insults fly: "Fascist folicles!" "Commie crunchies!" 
     - Fistfights erupt as the Zombies' lack of muscle coordination proves no match for the Proud Boys' UFC-inspired combat techniques.
     - The battle rages on, with the piercing sounds of clashing facial topiary echoing through the streets.
