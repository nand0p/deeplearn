Sgt. Hairyback (bellowing into bullhorn): "Listen up, my hirsute warriors! These woke Zombies seek to shave away our rugged freedom. But we won't let them defoliate our liberty with their vegan razors!"

A young Fentanyl Zombie (slurring): "Hey mannnn...why you gotta be so...judgydental? Just let your pits blossom, let your aura arrows flow freely, you know?"

Proud Boy: "Aura arrows? More like commie crap!" (Spits a huge loogy) "This is for disrespectin' 'Murica!"

The loogy lands squarely on the Zombie's dreadlocks. He doesn't seem to notice, too busy scribbling a poem about the unjust supremacy of the haircut-industrial complex on his buddy's forearm.

Sgt. Hairyback: "Alright boyzzz, stop flockin' around and form up in freedom folical formation!"

The Proud Boys quickly snap into a disciplined line, chest hairs standing at attention. Their leader stalks up and down, inspecting each caveman coiffure.

Sgt. Hairyback: "Outstanding! You're making the Founders proud with those rug regimens. Now...CHARGE!!"

With a unified "RRAAAGHBRBRBRBR" battle cry, the Proud Boys streak towards the Zombies, underwear preserved only by contoured merkins.

The Zombies, mid-bongo circle, barely have time to react before they're engulfed in a whirlwind of flying dreadlock trapperkeepers and broccolli curl body slams.

Zombie #1 (dazed): "Was it...was it good for you too, man?"


Sgt. Hairyback (flexing his squirrel pelt of a chest wig): "Nice try, dirt pedestrians! But your pathetic attempt at protest pruning will be no match for my regiment of follicle freedom fighters."

He gestures over his shoulder to the Proud Boys, each one sporting an even more egregiously excessive mane-sculpting than the last. There's a grizzly Adams family value crop, a Mr. Tumnus legs-for-days fluff, and a particularly unsettling merkin-molded tribute to Donald Trump's iconic swoop.

Sgt. Hairyback (continuing): "My brothers have trained for decades, allowing every naturalmente sprout to achieve its maximum mirkin'd potential. Whereas you...you sad, shaved snowflakes..."

He eyes the Fentanyl Zombies' ranges of depilation, from Brazilians to hairless hemophilia.

Sgt. Hairyback: "You all look like you were born on hairless ape island! My bakunawa bush could trounce the lot of you!"

A Proud Boy near the back can't resist yelling: "He's got a point, you bald besmirchers! We're the, ahem, hairier sex after all!"

The Fentanyl Zombies seem utterly nonplussed, continuing to absently braid rambling eco-feminist clump poetry into each other's patchouli detoxes.

Finally, one Zombie raises a hand, knuckle hair woven intricately with dandelion fluff: "Uhh, did anyone like, actually bring razors to this thing?"

Sgt. Hairyback paused to ruffle his chest meadow contemplatively. "My forebrothers didn't have their pelts forcibly shorn at Episylia for me to back down now!"

A young Proud Boy recruit furrowed his brow. "Epi-what now?"

"Epysilia, you uncivilized cretin!" Hairyback snarled, spraying spittle into the recruit's perfectly coiffed crustache. "The great body hair revolt of 602 BC? When the Greek man-pessimists tried to defoliate the valemen of Crete?"

The recruit's eyes glazed over as thick clumps of beard-honey dribbled uncomfortably down his chin.

"No? Nothing?" Hairyback stalked away in disgust. "What are they teaching you saps at Merkin Military Institute these days?"

His gaze landed on the Fentanyl Zombies, many now fashioning extended armpit dreads into unintelligible zine posters.

"At least those burnt bodhi bozos seem to recall their folickory! Didn't your tree-hugging, Teva-wearing tribesmen teach you about the great Depilatapilitan Wars?"

A Zombie glanced up vaguely from putting the finishing hydroponic highlights on her boyfriend's dreadlock peineta updo.

"Oh yeaaaah, when the imperial bushwhackers tried to eradicate all bodyhair ongaia's green MUTHA..." She trailed off, offering a wistful hair-wrapped friendship bracelet.

Sgt. Hairyback rolled his eyes so hard, his eyebrows achieved liftoff. "Ughh, no wonder this country's so scragged! We've got neanderhunks who've forgotten where they came from..."

He jabbed an accusing finger at the recruit's unkempt underbrush.

"And art-hairs so stoned, they think 'shaveculture' is just another one of Foucauuult's deconstructed prisons, maaaan."

A furious growth spurt overtook the recruit as Hairyback's dander levels reached vastatic heights.

"BABOON'S BUSHBRAID, I KNEW WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DISBANDED DON'T ASK, DON'T SHAVE!!"
